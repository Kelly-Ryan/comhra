# comhrá
CS4084 Mobile Application Development Project - Social media app called Comhrá (Irish word for "chat" pronounced koe-raw).

Comhrá is a social media application. Users can create an account and post status updates in the form of text and images. Other users can comment on these status updates and also edit their own profile.

**Installation**

If running the application from Android Studio then ensure the gradle files as well as the class and layout files are imported into the project. The app.gradle file contains all dependencies required in order for the application to run successfully.

The following will also need to be added to the project:

[Firebase Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/comhra-35d60/authentication/users)

[Cloud Firestore](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/comhra-35d60/firestore/data~2Fposts~2F15HCA4Isbhhxci1Xj6G1) 

[Firebase Storage](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/comhra-35d60/storage/comhra-35d60.appspot.com/files) 

Both Goetz and Michael have been invited as viewers to this Firebase project. Please notify me if further permission is required.

**Usage**

Once the app is installed on your device or running on the Android Studio emulator you may choose to create a new user account or login using one of the existing accounts.

Available existing accounts are:

 - pmurphy@yahoo.ie 
 - jm@ul.ie 
 - nj@yahoo.com 
 - aob@ul.ie 
 - johndoe@gmail.com

The password for each is test123.

On successful login a News Feed of existing posts will be displayed. From here you can navigate to:

 - Profile where you can view an edit your profile information
 - New Post where you can create and post a new status update with text 
   or an image    
 - Friends – this section is incomplete and navigates to a new activity where the user’s Friends List should be displayed.

**Project Status**

Due to unanticipated complexity and time cost ( estimate 120+ hours of development / debugging / R & D) the originally proposed friends functionality, notifications and logging out are not a part of the final product.
